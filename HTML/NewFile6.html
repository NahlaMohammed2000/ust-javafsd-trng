  <p>The 1940 Mandatory Palestine v Lebanon football match took place 
  on 27 April 1940 at the Maccabiah Stadium in Tel Aviv. Officiated by John Blackwell of 
  the British Army, the game was watched by around 10,000 spectators. It ended in a 5–1 victory 
  for Mandatory Palestine, who scored in the second minute, doubled their lead nine minutes 
  later with a penalty kick, and led the match 4–0 at halftime. This was Lebanon's first official 
  international match, and in the second half, forward Camille Cordahi scored the team's first goal in 
  official international play. Werner Kaspi answered with his second goal of the game, and the match 
  ended 5–1.</p>
